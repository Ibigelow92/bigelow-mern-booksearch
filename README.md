# bigelow-mern-booksearch

## Description

The purpose of this project was to gain experience creating an app that has the capability to personalize user data and to practice using GraphQL. It allows users to create an account so that they can search and save books. 

## Installation. 

To use this app, first clone it to your device. Run the commands `npm i` then `npm start` in your terminal. You will get a message that the app is listening on port 3001. Open your browser and navigate to `localhost:3001`. You will then be able to use the app. 

## Usage

To use the app, simply type the name of the book you want to search in the search bar. You will get a set of results that match your search criteria. You will see an image of the book cover, under which, there will be a save button. You can use the save button to have your saved books readily available for the next time you log on.
